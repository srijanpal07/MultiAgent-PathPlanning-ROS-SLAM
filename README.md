### Introduction
Enhancing navigation efficiency in dynamic environments with a ROS-based multi-agent system. Implemented diverse path planning algorithms including A*, Dijkstraâ€™s, and RRT* to guide Turtlebots through unknown terrain, overcoming static and dynamic obstacles. Centralized communication scheme consolidates 2D LiDAR SLAM data for comprehensive mapping, facilitating robust autonomous exploration.
